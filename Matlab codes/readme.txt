1)Dataset -https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients
2)DataPreprocessing - 	It can be found in the 'additional materials' folder 
    a)The UCI downloaded dataset is 'UCI_Credit_Card'
    b)the Preprocessing_of_Default_credit_card.ipynb contains the python code for the preprocessing of the dataset , the resulting dataset is the 'credit_card_new.csv'

3)Final MATLAB code 
 a) The logistic regression code is in the 'Logistic_regression_' mat file . 
   Steps to verify the output- 1) Most of the code has been commented except for the main model and the code used to predict the output on the dataset 
                               2) The accuracy, precision, recall, F1_score values are stored in the variables of names 'accuracy','Precision','Recall','F1_score' 
                                  which need to be run in the command window.
                                
                               
 
 b)The logistic regression code is in the 'Naive_Bayes_Models' mat file . 
   Steps to verify the output- 1) Most of the code has been commented except for the main model and the code used to predict the output on the dataset 
                               2) The accuracy, precision, recall, F1_score values are stored in the variables of names 'accuracy','Precision','Recall','F1_score' 
                                  which need to be run in the command window 
Note- The time taken to run the code  and train the model will be within a minute hence i have left it as it is .
